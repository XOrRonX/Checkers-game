# Checkers-game

### This is a two player checkers game built in ReactJS:

- The rules are normal checkers. Kings are made by reaching the opponents side, multi-jumping is possible.
- The project was started using the NPM create-react-app
- The game's business logic lives in the App.js component. The board is initialized as an class where key values represent board coordinates.
- Pieces for both players are stored as the values in the board object
- Each time a player moves including multi-jumps, the game records the board's state.
- When a pieces is selected, available moves (including jumps) are passed to the game's state.
